# Teaching Support

Invite a Subject librarian to your class for a hands-on workshop. Improve your students' research skills and make them confident, information-literate researchers.

We teach:

* How to identify useful information with advanced search strategies and techniques
* How to find and access specialized materials such as primary sources and government publications
* How to evaluate information
* How to improve the research flow process with citation tools RefWorks & Zotero
* How to use specialized software for projects, such as Omeka, Wordpress, Google Maps, ArcGIS etc.

View the Menu of Services for a list of options.

We create:

Library Guides
Ask for an online LibGuide for your course and embed it in Canvas. The guides can help your students in various ways:

* As a reference point where they can find all the information sources needed for their course
* As an educational tool to learn new research skills
* As a refresher to what has been taught in a library session in your class
  
Other Instruction Materials
We can help boost your students research skills with:

* Videos
* Handouts
* Tutorials

# Restrictions:

Librarians cannot:

* deliver a session if faculty is not present in the class
* give a session without a prior notice of at least 3 days
